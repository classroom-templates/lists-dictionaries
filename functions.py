# write a function called planets_list()
# pass it the planets dictionary and status list
# return the list of planets that are true planets
# base on the status list
#
# you may NOT use python methods; min, max, sum, or mean
# or any "magic" functions. you must use a loop to do
# this manually




# write a function called furthest()
# pass it the planets dictionary and an OPTIONAL boolean flag
# the flag decides if you use the CLOSEST distance or the FURTHEST
# distance to decide which planet is furthest
# in other words, use index 0 or 1 from the distance lists
# return the name of the furthest planet
#
# you may not use python methods; min, max, sum, or mean
